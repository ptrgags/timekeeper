# Timekeeper

This web page is a quick project I made to try out AngularJS. and MomentJS.
I decided to make something about timezones and Unix timestamps so I have an
easily accessible tool when programming or when conversing with friends in other
timezones.

## Features

* Convert the current local time to UTC, Unix Timestamp, an arbitrary timezone,
    and even Swatch Internet Time (just for fun)
* Compare two timezones to see how many hours are between them
* Convert a date and time from one timezone to another
* Convert a Unix timestamp to local time or to UTC

## Usage

To run locally, simply open index.html in a browser
